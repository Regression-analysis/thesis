The STEP-1-AND-2 folder is for doig things on digitalocean

The STEP-3 folder is for running lizard on each commit

The STEP-4 folder is for basically everything else

"messing-with-understand" is the code i used to run understand on every
commit

"nn" is the code i used when toying with neural nets instead of perphecy


Don't get too committed (haha, git pun) to my specific code. Hold onto the
high level ideas and dont be afraid to write from the ground up. I didn't
write this code to be used black box, because I didn't expect it to be used
by anyone but me. Classic mistake, right?
