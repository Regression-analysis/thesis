This nn file is code from me experimenting with using a neural network
instead of the perphecy threshold algorithm.

I think this is very cryptic stuff, especially because it is uncommented.
However, I will leave it in here in case you want to try and decrypt the general
idea of what was going on here.

At a high level, this file takes two arguments. The first is the path to a csv
file that has the indicator metrics and the hit/dismiss results
(like the "everything.csv" file). The second is a filename for the output.

Try running it, and then maybe if you are interested, dive in and see what is
happening. I think this code is written to try out a bunch of different loss
functions and optimizers in a big nested loop. It might take a long time to
run.
