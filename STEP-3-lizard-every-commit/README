This runs lizard on every commit.

You'll have to pip install some things. I never did learn the right
way to package up a python application, so I always just set up
a virtual environment and install the dependencies manually.

My tip? just run the file and pip install the thing that is missing
until it isnt missing anymore hahaha.

I think you'll need to pip install:
- lizard
- pymongo
- gitpython


Oh, also, I hardcoded the paths to the repositories. That's easy
enough to fix though.


Keep in mind that "commits_in_reverse_order" needs to hold the
commit shas that you need to run on.
