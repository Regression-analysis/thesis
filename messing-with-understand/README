This script is for running understand on every commit.
The "und_process.txt" file is a list of commands that understand understands (ha ha), which
is mostly configuration stuff. I tried to configure it to collect as MUCH data as possible.

Note: I did not use any of the understand data in my thesis. I did collect it though.

It needs a file called "git_commits" or something (check the script, i dont remember)
which is just a big list of every commit you want to run on, separated by newlines.


***NOT the module.exports javascript style file - just a file where each line 
is another commit
